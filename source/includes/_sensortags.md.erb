# Sensor Tags

Sensor tags are not available via the API. This documentation is included only for reference.

Sometimes, it's useful to associate tags to sensors, to make it easier to understand what the are. For instance, a _Carbon monoxide_ sensor may record _voltages_, and we may want to consider those readings as _raw_. This is represented with _SensorTags_. However, since _voltage_ can be also used for measuring electric properties, we use these tags, and not other ad-hoc [measurements](#measurements) to avoid duplication.

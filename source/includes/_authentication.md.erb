# Authentication

There are 2 ways you can access the API. OAuth 2.0 is the recommended method.

## OAuth 2.0

```shell
# Send authenticated POST for username 'user1', which should return the 'access_token'
$ curl -XPOST https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/sessions -d "username=user1" -d "password=password"

# OAuth2 Token (sent as a parameter)
$ curl -G https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/me?access_token=OAUTH-TOKEN

# OAuth2 Token (sent in a header)
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/me
```

<aside class="success">This is the recommended and safest way to access the API.</aside>

You can obtain a general `access_key` by sending an authenticated POST request to `https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/sessions`

A basic example resides here [https://example.smartcitizen.me](https://example.smartcitizen.me) and its source code is here [https://github.com/johnrees/smartcitizen-oauth-example](https://github.com/johnrees/smartcitizen-oauth-example).

## HTTP Basic Auth

<aside class="warning">This method enables you to authenticate your requests with your username and password. Despite using SSL we do not recommend this method as it can be very easy to accidentally share your secret credentials.</aside>

```shell
# Add a base64 encoded hash of 'username:password' in the header
curl 'https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/me' -H 'Authorization: Basic am9objpzbWFydHBhc3M='

# NOT RECOMMENDED - add username and password in the header
curl 'https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/me' --user username:password
```

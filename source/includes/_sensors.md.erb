# Sensors

<aside class='notice'>Every device belongs to a kit. And every kit has many sensors. So every device has one kit, which has many sensors.</aside>

Every [device](#devices) has `sensor(s)`. A `sensor` is something on a `device` that can record data. This could be anything, some examples are - temperature, humidity, battery percentage, # wifi networks.

## Get all Sensors
<%= `ruby ~/Desktop/docs.rb sensors` %>

Sensors can contain multiple sub-sensors, such as the DHT-22, which records temperature and humidity. In the CURL example `Sensor(id=3)` will not record any data, it is only in the database for organisational reasons.

## Get a single Sensor
<%= `ruby ~/Desktop/docs.rb sensors/5` %>

# Sensors

<aside class='notice'>Every device belongs to a kit. And every kit has many sensors. So every device has one kit, which has many sensors.</aside>

Every [device](#devices) has `sensor(s)`. A `sensor` is something on a `device` that can record data. This could be anything, some examples are - temperature, humidity, battery percentage, # wifi networks.

## Get all Sensors
<%= url 'sensors' %>
<%= `ruby ~/Desktop/docs.rb sensors` %>

Sensors can contain multiple sub-sensors, such as the DHT-22, which records temperature and humidity. If a sensor has a `parent_id` then it is a sub-sensor.

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
**id**<br/>*integer* | Autoincrementing unique ID for the sensor
**uuid**<br/>*uuid* | Unique ID for the sensor
**name**<br/>*string* | Name of the user
**description**<br/>*string* | Description of the user
**unit**<br/>*string* | The unit of measurement that is recorded with the sensor
**created_at**<br/>*datetime* | When the sensor was added to the platform
**updated_at**<br/>*datetime* | When the sensor was updated on the platform

## Get a single Sensor
<%= url 'sensors/:id' %>

<%= `ruby ~/Desktop/docs.rb sensors/5` %>

Will return same parameters as above, but for a single sensor.

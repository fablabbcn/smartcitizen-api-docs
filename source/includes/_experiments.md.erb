**ends_at**\*<br/>*datetime* | "2015-04-30T17:56:04.432Z" | When the experiment finished.
**device_ids**\*<br/>*Array* | [19, 149, 2902] | Array of devices IDs
**created_at**\*<br/>*datetime* | "2015-04-30T17:56:04.432Z" | When the experiment was created in the platform.
**updated_at**\*<br/>*datetime* | "2015-04-30T17:56:04.432Z" | When the experiment info was last updated.

## Add an Experiment

<%= url 'experiment', 'POST' %>

<%= `ruby generate_code.rb experiment POST` %>

You must be authenticated to add an experiment. The currently authenticated user will be registered as the `owner` of the new experiment.

**description**<br/>*string* | | Description of the experiment.
**starts_at**\*<br/>*datetime* | | When the experiment started.
**ends_at**\*<br/>*datetime* |  | When the experiment finished.
**device_ids**\*<br/>*Array* | | Array of devices IDs. Not necessarily owned by the owner of the experiment.

<aside class='warning'>Any user can create experiments on the platform and add **any** device to it. </aside>

## Update an experiment

<%= url 'experiment/:id', 'PATCH' %>

<%= `ruby generate_code.rb experiment/1 PATCH` %>

You must be authenticated and registered as the experiment's `owner` if you wish to update an experiment. See [Add an experiment](#add-an-experiment).

## Remove an experiment

<%= url 'experiment/:id', 'DELETE' %>

<%= `ruby generate_code.rb experiment/10 DELETE` %>

You can only delete experiments that you own. Deleting an experiment, doesn't delete the devices associated with them.

## Get All Experiments

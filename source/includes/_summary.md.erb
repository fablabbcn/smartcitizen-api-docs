## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS (with the exception of `/add`) and accessed via `api.smartcitizen.me`.

Blank fields are included as `null` instead of being omitted.

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`

## Root Endpoint

You can issue a GET request to the root endpoint to get all the endpoint categories that the API supports:

`$ curl https://api.smartcitizen.me`


## JSON-P Callbacks

You can send a `?callback` parameter to any GET call to have the results wrapped in a JSON function.

## Postman

We recommend that you try our API using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), we have created a shared collection that you can import from here [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/85a92402907e3cb07759](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/85a92402907e3cb07759)

## Versioning

By default, all requests receive the v0 version of the API. We encourage you to explicitly request this version via the URL or the HTTP Accept header.

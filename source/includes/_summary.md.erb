## Legacy

<aside class="notice">You might be wondering what happened to the original Smartcitizen API.</aside>


The [original API](http://legacy.developer.smartcitizen.me/) is still fully supported by the new backend in order your projects and experiments can keep running on the next months. 

However we encourage you to migrate to the new and more powerful API.

## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS (with the exception of `/add`) and accessed via `api.smartcitizen.me`.

Blank fields are included as `null` instead of being omitted.

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`

## Root Endpoint

You can issue a GET request to the root endpoint to get all the endpoint categories that the API supports:

`$ curl https://new-api.smartcitizen.me`


## JSON-P Callbacks

You can send a `?callback` parameter to any GET call to have the results wrapped in a JSON function.

## Postman

We recommend that you try our API using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), we have created a shared collection that you can import from here [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/85a92402907e3cb07759](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/85a92402907e3cb07759)

## Versioning

By default, all requests receive the v0 version of the API. We encourage you to explicitly request this version via the URL or the HTTP Accept header.
